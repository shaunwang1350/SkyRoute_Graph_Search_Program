# SkyRoute_Graph_Search_Program
## Summary
This is a project that was taught by CodeAcademy. The project focuses on deploying Breath-First Search and Depth-First Search algorithmns within the context of a city's metro station. The project included 4 additional python files: 'graph_search.py' contained bfs and dfs functions. 'vc_metro.py' was a file of dict with metro-stations and their links to other metro-stations. 'vc_landmarks.py' was a file that included landmarks and their closest metro-station, and 'landmark_choices.py' contained acrononyms associated to each landmark.

In this project, I created a very preliminary input interface, where the user will input their origin or starting position and ending position. Then the code will attempt to generate the shortest route to get from starting to ending position.
